# The Next Steps

- edit profile
  - add a description, contact information, interests, ...
- send messages to other members
- post travel plans...
  - ...and members of various communities (even those you can't see) from the area will be notified, and can invite you

[comment]: <> (the above seems hard... I'd limit it to others from your communities only?)

- connect to others
  - _create connectios_ with people you know `:me foaf:knows myFriend` (or a special hospex connection)
  - _write a reference_, to tell others about your experience with a particular member (social proof of safety)
- share your hosting offers in a more granular way (specific offers for specific communities)
- scale: geo index, group permissions when groups are large
- create and manage a community via an app
- customize the app to the needs of different communities
- display on a map members of other communities that trust the community of our app
